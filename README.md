## Features

- Automated detection of OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities.
- Support for multiple programming languages through static analysis tools.
- Rule-based checks for common vulnerabilities such as SQL injection and XSS.
- Detailed reporting of flagged vulnerabilities.

## Detailed Steps

1. **Research**
   - **OWASP Top 10 Vulnerabilities**: Study the OWASP Top 10 list to identify key vulnerabilities to detect.
   - **Static Code Analysis Tools**: Familiarize yourself with tools like Bandit (for Python) and FindSecBugs (for Java).

2. **Design Tool**
   - **Tool Architecture**: Create an architectural diagram showing how the tool will analyze code and report vulnerabilities.

3. **Development**
   - **Scripting**: Write scripts using static analysis libraries for different programming languages.
   - **Rule-Based Checks**: Implement rule-based checks for vulnerabilities like SQL injection, XSS, and hardcoded secrets.

4. **Testing**
   - **Testing on Open Source Projects**: Test your tool on popular open-source projects that have known vulnerabilities.
   - **Verification of Detected Issues**: Ensure that the tool flags the correct security issues by cross-referencing with known vulnerabilities.

5. **Documentation**
   - **Usage Instructions**: Write detailed documentation on how to run the tool, configure rules, and interpret results.
   - **Examples of Flagged Vulnerabilities**: Include examples showing vulnerabilities detected during testing.

6. **Optional: CI/CD Integration**
   - **Integrate into CI/CD**: Consider integrating the tool into a CI/CD pipeline to provide continuous security reviews.
   - **Commit History**: Maintain a meaningful commit history, highlighting significant developments.
   - **Showcase**: Provide examples of vulnerabilities detected in a demo or through screenshots.
