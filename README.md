# security-code-review-automation
The goal is to Develop a tool to automate security code reviews and detect common vulnerabilities in application code bases...


**Detailed Steps:**
1. Research:
    ● OWASP Top 10 Vulnerabilities:
      o Study the OWASP Top 10 list to identify key vulnerabilities to detect.
    ● Static Code Analysis Tools:
      o Familiarize yourself with static analysis tools like Bandit (for Python) and
        FindSecBugs (for Java).
2. Design Tool:
    ● Tool Architecture:
      o Create an architectural diagram showing how the tool will analyze code
        and report vulnerabilities.

3. Development:
    ● Scripting:
      o Write scripts using static analysis libraries for different programming
      languages.
    
    ● Rule-Based Checks:
      o Implement rule-based checks for vulnerabilities like SQL injection, XSS,
      and hardcoded secrets.
4. Testing:
    ● Testing on Open Source Projects:
      o Test your tool on popular open-source projects that have known
      vulnerabilities.
    ● Verification of Detected Issues:
      o Ensure that the tool flags the correct security issues by cross-referencing
        with known vulnerabilities.
5. Documentation:
    ● Usage Instructions:
      o Write detailed documentation on how to run the tool, configure rules, and
        interpret results.
    ● Examples of Flagged Vulnerabilities:
      o Include examples showing vulnerabilities detected during testing.
6. Optional: CI/CD Integration:
    ● Integrate into CI/CD:
      o Consider integrating the tool into a CI/CD pipeline to provide continuous
        security reviews.
    
    ● Commit History:
      o Maintain a meaningful commit history, highlighting significant developments.
    
    ● Showcase:
      o Provide examples of vulnerabilities detected in a demo or through screenshots
